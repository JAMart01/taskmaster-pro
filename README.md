## What It Does

An application that allows the user to keep track of things they need to do. It is in a Kanban style. Built Using HTML, JavaScript, and a little bit of CSS. The app keeps track of the users tasks and saves them in local storage so that they're available if the user closes the tab and comes back to it at a later time.
